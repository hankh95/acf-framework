# ACF-3: High School

**Score Range:** 40 -- 60

**Human Equivalent:** High school / undergraduate

## What This Level Means

An AI system certified at ACF-3 demonstrates **analytical reasoning** within a domain. It can:

- **Analyze** problems by breaking them into components
- **Compare** concepts, identifying similarities and differences without prompting
- **Draw connections** across topics within the domain
- **Construct** arguments with supporting evidence

## Cognitive Profile

At ACF-3, the system operates at the **Apply** and **Analyze** levels of Bloom's taxonomy. It can decompose problems, identify relationships, and organize information into coherent structures. It begins to handle ambiguity, though not reliably.

## Typical Capabilities

- Break down multi-part problems and solve them step by step
- Identify patterns and trends in data
- Distinguish relevant from irrelevant information
- Construct cause-and-effect chains spanning multiple steps
- Compare competing explanations and identify their strengths
- Apply learned concepts to moderately novel situations

## Limitations

- Cannot reliably evaluate the quality of competing arguments
- Cannot synthesize genuinely novel solutions
- Struggles with edge cases and adversarial inputs
- May not recognize the boundaries of its own knowledge

## When to Use ACF-3 Certification

ACF-3 is appropriate for systems that serve as **analytical assistants** in educational, research, or business contexts where users need help organizing, comparing, and reasoning about information across a defined domain.
