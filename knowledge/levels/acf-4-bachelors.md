# ACF-4: Bachelor's

**Score Range:** 60 -- 75

**Human Equivalent:** Bachelor's degree / entry professional

## What This Level Means

An AI system certified at ACF-4 demonstrates **professional competence** in a domain. It can:

- **Evaluate** the quality and validity of information, arguments, and solutions
- **Critique** work products using domain-appropriate standards
- **Demonstrate** independent judgment in routine professional scenarios
- **Justify** decisions with structured reasoning and evidence

## Cognitive Profile

At ACF-4, the system operates at the **Analyze** and **Evaluate** levels of Bloom's taxonomy. It can assess quality, make informed trade-offs, and exercise professional judgment. It handles ambiguity with reasonable confidence and can recognize the limits of its knowledge.

## Typical Capabilities

- Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of competing approaches
- Critique a document, design, or argument against professional standards
- Make defensible recommendations with explicit trade-off analysis
- Identify gaps, inconsistencies, or errors in domain-specific work
- Apply professional frameworks and methodologies independently
- Recognize when a problem exceeds its competence and escalate appropriately

## Limitations

- Cannot produce genuinely novel research contributions
- May miss subtle domain-specific nuances that experts would catch
- Cannot mentor or teach at an expert level
- Limited ability to handle unprecedented situations without guidance

## When to Use ACF-4 Certification

ACF-4 is appropriate for systems that serve as **professional assistants** or **junior colleagues** in workplace settings where independent judgment, quality evaluation, and professional-grade output are expected for routine tasks.
