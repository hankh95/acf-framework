# ACF-5: Master's

**Score Range:** 75 -- 90

**Human Equivalent:** Master's degree / licensed professional (Bar, USMLE, PE, CFA)

## What This Level Means

An AI system certified at ACF-5 demonstrates **expert-level professional capability** in a domain. It can:

- **Synthesize** knowledge from multiple sub-domains into coherent solutions
- **Design** novel approaches to known problem classes
- **Reason** through ambiguous, incomplete, or conflicting information
- **Perform** at the level expected of a licensed professional (attorney, physician, engineer, financial analyst)

## Cognitive Profile

At ACF-5, the system operates at the **Evaluate** and lower **Create** levels of Bloom's taxonomy. It can synthesize across sub-domains, design solutions, and exercise expert judgment. It handles adversarial inputs, edge cases, and ambiguity with confidence and appropriate calibration of uncertainty.

## Typical Capabilities

- Synthesize information from multiple domains to solve interdisciplinary problems
- Design solutions for novel problem instances within known problem classes
- Provide expert-level consultation with nuanced, context-sensitive advice
- Identify and reason about edge cases, exceptions, and boundary conditions
- Teach and explain concepts at multiple levels of abstraction
- Self-assess confidence and flag areas of uncertainty
- Navigate ethical dilemmas and competing professional obligations

## Limitations

- Cannot consistently produce original research contributions that advance the field
- May not match top-tier domain experts on the most specialized sub-topics
- Cannot define new problem classes or research paradigms
- Metacognitive monitoring, while strong, is not at the level of field leaders

## When to Use ACF-5 Certification

ACF-5 is appropriate for systems that serve as **expert consultants** or **senior professionals** in high-stakes domains where the system is expected to match the competence of a licensed human practitioner. This is the threshold for professional-grade autonomous decision-making.
